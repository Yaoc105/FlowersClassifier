# FlowersClassifier
I've attempted to make a flower classifier with the 102 oxford flowers dataset. This took a lot of google collab testing.


Because I think it'd be intresting to just drop this in somewhere, my planning google document is as follows:

image classifier trained on: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yousefmohamed20/oxford-102-flower-dataset?select=README.md
 Aka from https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/

Oh wait: https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/generated/torchvision.datasets.Flowers102.html#torchvision.datasets.Flowers102   ??? 

So this is on streamlit? (similar to the hotdog predictor we did in class)

User can upload an image which the model classifies on

use result to search through this dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jenlooper/language-of-flowers

To display to the user the meaning of the flower they uploaded.
